# How to Run

1. clone repo

2. run "npm run install-dependencies" in the base directory

4. run "npm start"

* for automated testing run "npm test" in the base directory (I didn't know how to do testing before this project. I hit a bug with importing the routes and was unable to run the server endpoints using Jest unfortunately

* for testing the API endpoints, use this postman workspace while the app is running
